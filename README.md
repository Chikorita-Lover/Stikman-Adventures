# Stikman Adventures
<b>Please keep in mind that <i>Stikman Adventures</i> is purely just concept. No actual programming has begun.
If you would like to see the original <i>Stikman</i> project, head on over to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/213434956/">Stikman Scratch (Version 1.4.3) on Scratch</a>.</b>

<i>Stikman Adventures</i> is my indie video game concept that I've been working on since late 2017, with no set release date as of now.
It is a 2D platformer, where you can play as several different characters known as Stikopians.
You can use minerals you obtain along the way to power you up, such as Diamonds and Emeralds.
Weapons help you defeat enemies, and you have to watch out for your Diamond Mineral Points (a.k.a. MP): your health.
Losing all your health will then use up one plate of Emerald Sticks to revive you.

## Story
<i>The story of </i>Stikman Adventures<i> takes place on Mount Madeline in Stikopa.
The main protagonist, Stikman, has a cave of Golden Sticks that is one day attacked by the Devilship, which is an aircraft operated by the Devil Dancers.
Stikman and his two friends that are with him, Stike and Stikelle, attempt to rush in and take as many Golden Sticks as they can before something bad happens.
While inside, the Devilship throws down a large anchor onto the cave and pull it out of the ground into the sky.
After a while, Stikman and his friends are suddenly slashed from behind by an unknown source, which causes them and his Golden Sticks to fall out all across Stikopa.
Stikman, Stike, and Stikelle all fall near the top of Mount Madeline at Tourmaline Outlook.
They then see the damage that has been dealt to Stikopa by the Devil Dancers, who have tried to separate the different towns to prevent communication and stop Stikman and his friends from chasing them.
The Devilship flees to the other side of Stikopa where the country's volcano rests...</i>
